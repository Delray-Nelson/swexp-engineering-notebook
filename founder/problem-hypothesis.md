# Problem Hypothesis

## Part 1 — Pitch & Extracted Problem

**Product Pitch:**
We are building an automated, real-time log ingestion and anomaly detection engine that parses raw server traffic and application stack traces, alerting engineering teams on Slack before customers notice downtime.

---
**Extracted Problem (stripped of features and tech):**
Operations and engineering leads lose hours during production incidents trying to manually correlate web traffic spikes with internal system errors across scattered log files.

---

## Part 2 — The Hypothesis

## Who
B2B engineering leads, DevOps managers, and web technology managers at mid-sized logistics and SaaS companies who oversee production application stability.

## When (the moment)
When an unexpected system outage or customer checkout failure occurs, and team members must urgently determine the root cause under high-pressure recovery timelines.

## Cost
**Time & Money:** 2–5 hours of senior engineer time per incident spent manually running CLI log searches, costing ~$300–$1,000 in lost engineering capacity per outage.  
**Risk & Emotion:** High operational stress, SLA breach penalties, and customer churn due to prolonged downtime.

## Current Behavior
Engineers manually SSH into server environments to run basic terminal pipeline commands (`grep`, `awk`, `tail -f`) across raw log files, or manually cross-reference disconnected monitoring tools. They accept this friction because heavy enterprise observability platforms are costly or complex to configure.

## Scores
- **Frequency:** `weekly` because medium-to-high traffic web applications generate error spikes or performance regressions routinely every sprint.
- **Intensity:** `blocking` because active outages prevent end users from completing core transactions or workflows.
- **Existing spend:** `significant time` because senior engineering bandwidth is consumed during manual incident triage.
- **Reachability:** `I can name N candidates` because I work directly within web/marketing technology and software engineering environments.

## Riskiest assumption
Engineering teams prefer lightweight CLI-driven stream processing pipelines over existing, full-featured GUI log management platforms (e.g., Datadog, Splunk).

## Kill condition
If, after ~10 discovery interviews, I find that operations teams already have automated, low-cost log correlation in place and view manual CLI parsing as a minor nuisance rather than a costly bottleneck, I will drop or reshape this hypothesis.
